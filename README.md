The website MUST use CSS, pleasant colors and fonts, be easy to read and maneuver with clear and distinct links, including epsilon 3 features, epsilon 3 options, and epsilon prices. You can add additional pages as desired. 
Your website must use pleasing background colors, easy to read text, at least 3 html links (2 to local pages that you create and 1 to an outside source) You should use at least 3 of the basic HTML commands we have covered so far in class.
